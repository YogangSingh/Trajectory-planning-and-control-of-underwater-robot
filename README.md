This file contains the information on how to access the code and run it.
1.	Download and save all the files in the same folder.
2.	Create another folder and name it as "utils" within the folder created above.
3.	Move all the files except the files name starts with "run" into "utils" folder . These are the function files used in the code.
4.	Here we have 5 "run" files. Each of them has its own purpose and waypoints and gains.
5.	"Run_case1.m" and "Run_case2.m" files are used to tune the controller.
6.	"Run_result_case1.m" and "Run_result_case2.m" files are used to test the controller after it is tuned.
