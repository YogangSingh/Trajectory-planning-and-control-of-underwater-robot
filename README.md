This file contains the information on how to access the code and run it.
1.	Download and save all the files in the same folder.
2.	Unzip the "utils" file in the same folder with same name "utils". It contains the functions used in the code.
4.	Here we have 5 "run" files. Each of them has its own waypoints and gains.
5.	"Run_case1.m" and "Run_case2.m" files are used to tune the controller.
6.	"Run_result_case1.m" and "Run_result_case2.m" files are used to test the controller after it is tuned.
